# YeP API

## What you need

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/): This project uses `Node v 12.17.0`, we try to stay on the latest stable or releast candidate version. We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for nodejs version management but feel free to use what works for you.

- [Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm): This project uses `Npm v 7.11.0`. You can grab the latest version of npm using `npm install -g npm@latest`. You will need this to grab all the dependencies of the application.

- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/): You can grab the latest version of postgres by downloading it directly on the website.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com): We use [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) for version control and collaboration.
  If you don't have a [Gitlab](https://github.com) account already you can create one [here](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up).
  Follow instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to install the latest version of Git for your system.
